title: Project 2.  Predict Margin of Victory(MOV) in University of Michigan Football
---
For the Project 2 at Metis bootcamp, students had opportunities to select their own topics to build predictive regression models.
I decided to build a regression model that predicts margin of victory(MOV) of 2019 season games for the University of Michigan football. Since graduating from University of Michigan (UM), I became a big fan of UM sports. Although Michigan is not playing as well as we are expecting, let's support and cheer coaches and players as true Michigan fans. GO BLUE!!

## Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

The data was acquired from

## Analysis (Place, Day, Time)

#### Places

The entrance and exit traffic for top 10 stations were accounting for about 20% of total traffic. A Figure 1 shows list of top 10 stations with their percentage of traffic among top 10 stations. For example, Penn Station, located on 34th street, is about 15%(~ 11 millions) of top 10 traffics.

#### Day and Time

A Figure 2 shows percentrage of traffic vs. day of week. As expected, this graph clearly shows that working days, from Monday to Friday, have the most traffic. Thus, placing street steams on the working days is desirable.

A Figure 3 shows percentage of traffic vs. time of day. The most traffic occurs between 4:00 and 8:00 pm, thus placing street teams in this time period would be practical. If you really have to outreach on weekend, the same time period will be applied, as shown in Figure 4.

## Street Team Strategy

Our strategy is based on percentage of total traffic for the top 10 stations, as shown in Figure 1. For example, if our clients have total of 100 available people to place on the street, then about 15 people in Penn Station, 13 in Grand Central Station, and so on. The best day and time to place people on the street is between Monday and Friday with 8:00 am and 8:00 pm with an strong emphasis on 4:00 and 8:00 pm.
