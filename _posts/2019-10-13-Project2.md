title: Project 2.  Predict Margin of Victory(MOV) in University of Michigan Football
---
For the Project 2 at Metis bootcamp, students had opportunities to select their own topics to build predictive regression models.
I decided to build a regression model that predicts margin of victory(MOV) of 2019 season games for the University of Michigan football. Since graduating from University of Michigan (UM), I became a big fan of UM sports. Although Michigan is not playing as well as we are expecting, let's support and cheer coaches and players as true Michigan fans. GO BLUE!!
